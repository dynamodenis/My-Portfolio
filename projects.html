        <h2>1.Dynamo Shop</h2>
        <p>Dynamo Shop was my first project to get involved in when I started the Web Development journey. 
            Its intiation was in Moringa School as an Independent project so with time I perfected my designing and programming journey 
            which I have to admit has been very exiting. <br>
            The general idea for this project was based on the fact that there has been an increase in the number
            of smart form users in Kenya and enjoying the fastest internet serfing in the continent, we have 
            to breach the gap between our traditional way of doing business and jump to the new era of <strong>E-Commerce</strong>
            which has been successful in bringing sellers and buyers closer there increasing the market and sales of products. <br>
