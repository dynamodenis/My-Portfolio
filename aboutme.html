    <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
        <p>The world is changing every single day and the most complex of things have been reduced to mare clicks on a keyboard.
            I am priveledged to be part of a group of people who make ideas into reality. As a developer having worked on different 
            platforms, different environment and with different people have made me become a better person both in my private and 
            personal life. I believe people who always gets ahead are not the smartest people but the bold, its not about what I 
            know but what I can be able to learn.
